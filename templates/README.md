# Templates

This folder is broken up into two main sections. The files that are included in the root folder are maintained by OOS. The files in the subfolders are maintained by individuals and the folder name is their Github username so they can be contacted for any bugs/issues/feedback.

Given that OOS-TAPI is based around the concept of each developer has their own needs, all the files in this folder and subfolders should be used as examples. It is recommended that you build your own templates for your projects.
